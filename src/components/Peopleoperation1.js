          The volume of human capital data in modern organization expands day by
          day; modern organizations need to rapidly respond to align their
          <br />
          business strategy with their human capital investment by optimizing
          employee productivity. Organizations need to be empowered with an
          <br />
          efficient and accurate technology solution.The solution must enable
          analytical tools to provide management insight into employee
          competencies
          <br />
          by facilitating data driven decision making.

        <Div5>Enterprise Success with Competency Risk Management</Div5>
        <Div6>
          Competency Risk Management is recognized globally as one of the
          essential functions of an employee’s Health, Safety, Security and
          <br />
          Environmental (HSSE) related activities and associated financial
          liabilities in the current business scenario.
        </Div6>
        <Div7>
          In the Energy & Utilities Sector, companies have an urgent need to
          manage their employee competency as well as employee regulatory
          <br />
          compliance. This management of competency enables employees to be
          deployed into the correct job / role safely. As witnessed in the
          recent
          <br />
          past, the many hazardous incidents that have occurred in both the oil
          and gas industry have made the companies in these sectors realize the
          <br />
          urgent need for greater scrutiny of competencies and regulatory
          compliance in managing the risks during job performance.
        </Div7>
        <Div8>
          In a day-to-day scenario, an employee might be asked to multitask
          across a number of roles due to (for example) shortage of resources or
          <br />
          urgency for job completion in the field. In such scenarios, an
          employee may be deployed into the field with no accurate evidence
          validating their
          <br />
          competencies and training requirements. Lack of these measures to
          monitor employee competency will eventually lead to serious
          consequences
          <br />
          including high probability of incidents in the field.These incidents
          invariably lead to major environmental and life threatening results
          that also
          <br />
          drive large scale financial and reputational consequences.
        </Div8>
        <Div9>
          Companies in the Energy & Utilities Sector need to reduce their
          employee costs by increasing their flexibility and adaptability. For
          such
          <br />
          companies to emerge as market leaders, they must innovate and
          implement global employee practices, train their workforce and have
          robust
          <br />
          workforce planning tools and methodologies in place.
        </Div9>
        <Div10>
          Competency Management is a complex process that focuses on an
          employee’s competency with respect to knowledge, skills and
          performance.
          <br />
          Competency analysis enables the management to ensure that all
          employees are enabled with the correct competencies to successfully
          perform
          <br />
          their duties in the field. This eventually leads to successful
          achievement of business goals for the organization. The key factor
          that drives
          <br />
          performance driven business success is having the right people with
          the right skills and competencies deployed in the field. Competency
          <br />
          Management forms the foundation for any corporate
        </Div10>
        <Div11>
          HR function in an organization that includes Recruitment, Workforce
          Planning, Succession Planning, Learning and Development, Performance
          <br />
          Management and Talent Planning. Competency Management has strategic
          integration points with all the functions of Talent Management. The
          <br />
          Talent Management Process areas are typically enabled via a
          combination of technology solution with an HR Management System as the
          core.

        <Div13>
          According to a research conducted by Bersin & Associates (Figure 1
          above), Competency Management is one of the top-most high-impact
          <br />
          process areas impacting business execution results. Some of the key
          drivers for this are:
        </Div13>
        <Div14>
          Performance driven organizations thrive on well-defined Competency
          Frameworks which are critical for the success of any business
          <br />
          Competency Risk Management ensures that qualified people with the
          necessary skills are deployed on the job
          <br />
          Competency Risk Management identifies employee skill gaps and supports
          employees with career development opportunities
        </Div14>
        <Div15>
          <Div16>The Problem:</Div16>
          <Div17>Reducing Organizational Risk</Div17>
        </Div15>
        <Div18>
          Modern organizations rarely have time or relevant metrics pertaining
          to their employee’s competency and evidences required to perform their
          <br />
          jobs efficiently and safely. In today’s data rich organizations, the
          management is facing continual demand to drive performance and they do
          not
          <br />
          have a substantial way to identify correct competencies and providing
          accurate analysis about their workforce.
        </Div18>
        <Div19>
          The challenge we face is that our subcontractors and internal
          organizations typically use different terminology and have different
          taxonomies of
          <br />
          competencies. Without automated tools to map one set of competencies
          to another, managers are faced with the daunting task of determining
          <br />
          what competence gaps subcontractors or employees have as they are
          deployed to working teams. When competence gaps exist, we must offer
          <br />
          proper training interventions to address them.
        </Div19>
        <Div20>
          Competency assessment is eventually carried out on the basis of static
          generalities derived from summaries of qualification and
          certifications
          <br />
          rather than individual competency and evidences. Organizations have no
          way to determine what information is relevant to a particular job at a
          <br />
          particular time in a particular environment and to evaluate concrete
          evidence that demonstrates competence.
        </Div20>
        <Div21>
          This approach leads to inaccurate conclusions which appear to be valid
          in a particular context but easily misinterpreted when viewed from a
          <br />
          cross functional perspective in an organization. Modern, rapidly
          changing work environments require a dynamic and adaptive workforce
          that is
          <br />
          assessed on the basis of the actual training taken rather than only on
          the reported results of that training. Some of the typical scenarios
          are as
          <br />
          below -
        </Div21>
        <Div22>
          Organizations need to be accurate in hiring people with the right
          skills, knowledge and behavioral traits for each role, as it is
          difficult for
          <br />
          businesses to identify the competency risks hidden within a composite
          workforce
          <br />
          Inexperienced decisions by an employee or contractor can seriously
          damage a well-established business
          <br />
          Due to the gaps in the key positions and core skills required, the
          proficiency of an individual gets affected and thereby the efficiency
          of the
          <br />
          workforce reduces which could create risks in the workplace
          <br />
          It is difficult to identify which employee needs which type of
          training. This increases the cost in giving irrelevant training to the
          employees
          <br />
          and results in wastage of time
          <br />
          Due to lack of competencies in employees, there is a loss of employee
          fitment within the company and this leads to dependency on
          <br />
          contractors and increased costs
        </Div22>
        <Div23>
          To address these problems, a standards based Competency Management
          system is needed. This system must provide functionality that enables
          <br />
          taxonomies of competencies to be mapped across organizations or
          organizational units, training to be mapped to competencies on the
          basis of
          <br />
          multiple factors including the actual content used in the training,
          and employee skill gaps to be recognized and remediated using
          available
          <br />
          training interventions.
        </Div23>
        <Div24>Why not a Learning Management System?</Div24>
        <Div25>
          As one looks deeper into the problem of mapping training to
          competencies, one finds the issue aggravated by the way that Learning
          <br />
          Management Systems (LMS) work. LMSs typically store competency data
          internally in ways that cannot be shared with other systems and the
          <br />
          competency data they do track is defined by the content in the form of
          learning objectives that are not matched to global competencies.
          <br />
          Moreover, objectives are often hierarchical, with “enabling learning
          objectives” that imply or are required by “terminal learning
          objectives.” Data
          <br />
          about these hierarchical relationships must be stored and acted upon
          to successfully identify competency gaps.
        </Div25>
        <Div26>
          In the case of Learning Management Systems, providing access to
          enterprise competency definitions is a significant advance. However,
          the
          <br />
          primary focus revolves around enabling learning content and related
          outcomes defined by the content creators and consumed by the LMS.
          <br />
          Mapping learning content to competencies in an enterprise is usually
          an ad-hoc process which may not be fully supported by an LMS.
          Workforce
          <br />
          competency risk is elevated as the management has no way to track or
          monitor their workforce skills readiness using an LMS. This leads to a
          <br />
          substantial need to have a system to manage and mitigate competency
          risks.
        </Div26>
        <Div27>Moving Beyond One-Line Definitions</Div27>
        <Div28>
          Organizations traditionally rely on systems that define jobs and
          competencies using general descriptions and job titles (e.g.
          technician).
          <br />
          Competency models built on such descriptions work well in a given
          context but lead to high degree of misinterpretation when communicated
          <br />
          across multiple organizations or when viewed by a manager who is not a
          domain expert.
        </Div28>
        <Div29>
          Competency and job definitions may have different meaning in a
          different context within the same or different organization. This
          creates
          <br />
          significant risk when a company outsources tasks to a subcontractor or
          when departments with different responsibilities team up or transfer
          <br />
          personnel.
        </Div29>
        <Div30>
          Today, organizations need a technology that is able to objectively
          analyze and map the competency models using a standard taxonomy and
          <br />
          reduces risk by providing the organization with accurate mapping of
          people to jobs and competencies.
        </Div30>
        <Div31>Importance of Enterprise-Wide Competency Risk Management</Div31>
        <Div32>
          Human risk must be managed across an entire enterprise rather than in
          silos, as is often done today. If organizations embrace competency
          <br />
          management in their growth plan, it will lead to centralized and
          standardized system in the organization with an efficient mechanism to
          manage
          <br />
          the workforce. Suitably tracked competency management benefits your
          enterprise to:
        </Div32>
        <Div33>
          Identify gaps in skills, knowledge and performance
          <br />
          Identify where training is needed
          <br />
          Identify the right person with the right competency in the right role
          <br />
          Map all competencies and thereby will develop an effective education,
          training and skill upgrading scheme for the entire organisation
          <br />
          Align the entire workforce to the overall strategic goals of the
          organisation
        </Div33>
        <Div34>
          This will eliminate operational risk, financial risk and risk to brand
          image.
        </Div34>
        <Div35>
          To conclude, implementing a Competency Risk Management Framework sets
          a strong foundation for the HSSE practices at the organization level
          <br />
          and extended enterprise aligning the critical talent processes and
          enabling smooth business operations. Competency assessment, mapping
          and
          <br />
          management ultimately leads to change management to transition
          individual, team and organisation from current state to desired future
          state.
